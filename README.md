# NFLPenalties

## Data scraped with BeautifulSoup parser from following sources:
1. [http://www.nflpenalties.com/](http://www.nflpenalties.com/)
2. [http://www.pro-football-reference.com/officials](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/officials)
3. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums)

Data primarily stored in csv files (for ease of analysis with R and/or Python), imported into Pandas dataframes, and displayed in matplotlib.

## TODO:
1. Organize directory structure
2. More systematic data analysis of individual referees, players, and teams
3. Machine-learning algorithms (via scikit-learn?) to predict penalties given variety of factors
